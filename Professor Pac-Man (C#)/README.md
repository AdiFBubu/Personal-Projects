&emsp;&emsp;This application contains forms for displaying, buttons: for navigating from one page to another, but also for choosing the answers to the proposed grids, closing the windows by using the X button in the top right corner, and the application by using the X button in the second form (the one with the computer skills test). <br>

&emsp;&emsp;**STRUCTURE OF THE INFORMATION PRODUCT**

&emsp;&emsp;By pressing the button - "Let's get started!" you will access the main window - with the computer science exercises. <br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;**2. Second window - solving the 20 exercises**

&emsp;&emsp;This window contains 20 execises, each with 4 suggested answers, only one of which is correct. At the end of solving all the execises, a message will be displayed with a short statistic of the user's evaluation

&emsp;&emsp;As the exercises are solved, the user can interact with the button - "Are you bored? Come on, let's play!", which opens the last window - the PAC-MAN game. Note that the user's progress within the execises is saved (when returning from the PAC-MAN game window, the user will have to solve the exercise he/she was stuck on before accessing the button to the game). <br><br>

&emsp;&emsp;**3.Third window - the PAC-MAN game**

&emsp;&emsp;Once in this window, the game starts. The aim of the game is to collect all 34 coins without being touched by the 3 moving ghosts and without hitting the green walls. In this case, the message "You win!" will be displayed at the end. However, if one of the unfavorable events, mentioned above, occurs, the game stops with the message: "You lose!". To restart the game, press the ENTER key. When the user feels it is time to go back to solving the grid, all he has to do is press the red "X" button in the top-right corner.
