&emsp;You are asked to make a to-do list. <br>
&emsp;In the first phase add the desired categories from the keyboard (example: enter the task categories: / possible answers: class, shopping, work, gifts, etc.) <br>
&emsp;Requirements:<br>
* you will be prompted, one at a time, to enter a task from the keyboard (e.g: homework solving)
* you will be asked to enter a deadline for the task (e.g: 22.01.2022 21:30)
* add a person responsible for the task (e.g: Ion Vasile)
* add a category that the task belongs to. (E.g. course)

&emsp;Attention, the category must exist. If it does not exist, an error message is displayed. <br>
&emsp;There will be the possibility to add an unlimited number of tasks, even after the user confirms that they are done entering tasks. <br>
&emsp;The data is saved in files. There will be two files: one for categories and one containing: tasks, due date, responsible person, category. <br><br>
&emsp;**Additional requirements:** <br>
&emsp;A menu is displayed from which the user can choose to perform the following operations: <br>
&emsp;&emsp;I.List data: in the initial data display a sort by category is performed. <br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;II.Sort: select one of the 8 options below: <br>
* ascending sort task
* task descending sort
* sort ascending date
* sort descending date
* sort ascending person responsible
* top-down sort person responsible
* sort ascending category
* sort descending category

&emsp;&emsp;III. Data filtering: data filtering is actually a listing of data according to certain details given from the keyboard. The filtering criteria are: (the field by which filtering is performed is requested from the keyboard) <br>
* Task
* Date
* Person responsible
* Category <br>
&emsp;After choosing the field from the keyboard, you are asked to enter a string used for filtering in the initial list of data, so that only the data containing/beginning with the entered value remain in the initial list.
&emsp;The remaining list is displayed <br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;IV. Adding a new task to the initial list <br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;V. Edit the task, date, person or category details of a particular task chosen by the user from the keyboard (when this option is requested, the list of tasks will be listed with a unique identifier per row, so that the user knows what information to edit) <br><br>
&emsp;&emsp;VI. Delete a task from the initial list. <br>
&emsp;Attention! You must be careful that a category can only exist once (duplicates are not accepted, e.g. course, shopping, work, gifts, course is wrong) <br>
&emsp;Also, when adding tasks care should be taken when comparing task texts, if the respective text exists, it cannot be added.
