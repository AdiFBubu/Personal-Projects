&emsp;The https://www.mai.gov.ro/informare-covid-19-grupul-de-comunicare-strategica-10-decembrie-ora-13-00-2/ website lists the number of data reported at county level for that day. <br>
&emsp;The URL used is provided for December 10, 2023, so requests can be automated. If no data is found at the desired request on a given day (there are exceptions where the url is formatted differently at the end), those urls will be passed by hand. We want to realize a common table by counties for the days 10.12, 11.12, 12.12, 13.12, 014.012. Export the data in Excel.<br>
&emsp;The final table should have the following header:<br>

NR. CRT | County | 01.03 | 02.03 | 03.03 | 04.03 | 05.03 |
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
1 | Alba | 51.477 | 51.599 | 51.717 | 51.827 | 51.917 |
... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
Total | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |  

The values in the tables for the days represent the number of confirmed cases (total)
